# Summary
## Goals
- I want to send $DEGEN to a friend that has never used crypto before.
## Before
- I tell my friend to install metamask, he downloads it and sends me his address, I send him crypto
## Key Insight
- Embedded Wallets + Account Abstraction allows you to send crypto to users without them needing a wallet to receive the token
## UX Walkthrough
- The sender deposits the token to a contract and generates a password
- The sender sends the link with the password, which prompts the user to create a sign in with google wallet (privy)
- The user can send the token to another address, or hold it in his privy wallet

# Walrus - use it to store password hints

need deterministic app ids
how long is storage epoch

# Story - Send Royalty tokens
- is there a hackathon quickstart to create ipfi and mint stuff

# Sign protocol
https://docs.sign.global/for-hackers/getting-started
- would password hint storage on sign protocol be useful/good idea?

# The graph
Create a subgraph for this and store bytes + amounts
